        title="NodeSecure - The future" 
        content="<p>Hello üëã</p>
<p>Today I'm writing to tell you about <strong>the future of <a href=&quot;https://github.com/ES-Community/nsecure&quot;>NodeSecure</a></strong> üëÄ.</p>
<p>I have not been very active in the last few months because of my job which has taken up a lot of my time. But I'm back üòä.</p>
<p>Moving forward and updating the project has become much more complicated üòµ. <strong>So it was time to announce and make major changes</strong>.</p>
<h2>What is node-secure (or nsecure) ?</h2>
<p>Node-secure is a CLI that will fetch and deeply analyze the dependency tree of a given npm package (Or a local project with a package.json) and output a .json file that will contains all metadata and flags about each packages.</p>
<p>The CLI is able to open the JSON and draw a Network of all dependencies (UI and emojis flags will help you to identify potential issues and security threats).</p>
<h2>üè´ Creating an organization</h2>
<p>NodeSecure is not only one tool anymore. The project is now a set of tools and packages that need to be maintained and extended. The project has also gained contributors on its way and many developers pushed me to go even further üöÄ.</p>
<p>That's why I decided to <strong>gather</strong> these different projects in the <strong>same github organization</strong> (and same for <strong>npm</strong> with <code>@nodesecure</code>). It will also be easier to integrate new collaborators into the project.</p>
<p>The URL to our new home: <a href=&quot;https://github.com/NodeSecure&quot;>https://github.com/NodeSecure</a></p>
<h2>üìã Roadmap</h2>
<p>Well, that's all very nice, but what is the objective in concrete terms? The goal is to release a version 1.0 with the following roadmap:</p>
<h3>Move all the packages in the org</h3>
<ul>
<li>js-x-ray</li>
<li>sec-literal</li>
<li>size-satisfies</li>
<li>npm-tarball-license-parser</li>
<li>Migrating SlimIO/Security into the org and rename it <strong>@nodesecure/report</strong>.</li>
<li>Rewriting <a href=&quot;https://github.com/SlimIO/Npm-registry&quot;>SlimIO/npm-registry</a> from zero in the org (with <a href=&quot;https://github.com/nodejs/undici&quot;>undici</a> as http client).</li>
</ul>
<p>We will update these packages and they will use ESM by default.</p>
<h3>Split Nsecure into three parts</h3>
<p>We will rewrite the Nsecure back-end logic into an independent package named <strong>scanner</strong>. The CLI and the UI will also be separated in two distinct packages.</p>
<p>We will focus our efforts initially <strong>on the scanner</strong>. The objective is above all to simplify maintenance by separating the project into minimal parts that can be more easily documented, evolved and tested.</p>
<p>This should also reduce the number of dependencies for tools that only want to use the scanner without the CLI and UI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è We will update the current <a href=&quot;https://github.com/ES-Community/nsecure&quot;>nsecure</a> package with the new components until the new version arrives.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>New UI</h3>
<p>The NodeSecure web interface will be rewritten from scratch. This new project will use <strong><a href=&quot;https://d3js.org/&quot;>D3.js</a></strong> to generate the network graph.</p>
<p>It will also be a good opportunity to discuss what we will use for the new interface.</p>
<h2>üë• The team</h2>
<p>I am pleased to announce that I am launching this initiative with <a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonygorez/&quot;>Tony Gorez</a> who, as you know, has contributed a lot to the project in recent months.</p>
<p>Several developers have indicated their intention to actively participate... so the team will grow very quickly.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning and you are welcome to join us if you want to contribute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>üí¨ We use Discord to communicate. My Discord tag fraxken#8064.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è</h2>
<p>And that's it! A lot of work ahead for us. The new interface will certainly take a few months to be created so don't expect V1 anytime soon.</p>
<p>However those changes should allow us to release a 0.9 and 0.10 version very quickly in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Best Regards,
Thomas</p>
